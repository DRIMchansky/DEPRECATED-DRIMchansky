Second website based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and first experience with CSS-in-JS library [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). It's not finished yet. Getting data from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) CMS and little bit of [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com) styles.
